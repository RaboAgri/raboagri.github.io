<h1>Rise of the Rural Entrepeneur</h1>
<p>All the data you need to help solve the challenges!</p>

<img src="data/backgrnd.png" alt="ruralentrepeneurs" width="700" height="460">

<b>SITUATION</b><br/>
Population growth worldwide means more mouths to feed in the near future. </br>
Yet, the number of farmers is decreasing, the amount of arable farm land is decreasing and natural resources are becoming scarce, too.  </br>
As global population grows, the shrinking farmer population is burdened with trying to produce more with less. 
<br/><br/><b>GOAL</b><br/>
One of our ongoing goals is to support and prepare farmers for both the current and future changes in the market, production and environment. </br>
To remain relevant, farmers of the future will need to increase economic viability, work within ecological boundaries, and build a better image as rural entrepreneurs.
<br/><br/><b>CHALLENGE AND ISSUES</b><br/>
For this challenge, we will focus on the issues and challenges for dairy farmers. </br>
We are seeking to find both practical and creative solutions to what these farmers need to do individually or together to arrive at 100% sustainable production in 2020.
<br/><p/>

<ol type="1">
  <li><b>SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATION:</b> <br/>
  Use data to generate (new) insights between input, output and production values.</li>
  <li><b>DATA COOPERATION:</b> <br/>
  Design a solution in which data sharing can help farmers improve their production.</li>
  <li><b>FAIR PRICING:</b> <br/>
  Can dairy prices for farmers and other parties in the supply chain be generated or negotiated more fairly using software solutions?</li>
  <li><b>NOTHING WASTED:</b> <br/>
  Take on the challenge of decreasing food waste in one or all parts of the supply chain.</li>
  <li><b>DATA VISUALISATION:</b> <br/>
  Get creative with one or more datasets and design visual interfaces that give insights more easily.</li>
</ol>
