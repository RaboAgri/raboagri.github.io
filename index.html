<b>SITUATION</b><br/>
Population growth worldwide means more mouths to feed in the near future. Yet, the number of farmers is decreasing, the amount of arable farm land is decreasing and natural resources are becoming scarce, too.  As global population grows, the shrinking farmer population is burdened with trying to produce more with less. 
<br/><br/><b>GOAL</b><br/>
One of our ongoing goals is to support and prepare farmers for both the current and future changes in the market, production and environment. To remain relevant, farmers of the future will need to increase economic viability, work within ecological boundaries, and build a better image as rural entrepreneurs.
<br/><br/><b>CHALLENGE AND ISSUES</b><br/>
For this challenge, we will focus on the issues and challenges for dairy farmers. We are seeking to find both practical and creative solutions to what these farmers need to do individually or together to arrive at 100% sustainable production in 2020.
<br/><p/>

<ol type="1">
  <li><b>SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATION:</b> Use data to generate (new) insights between input, output and production values.</li>
  <li><b>DATA COOPERATION:</b> Design a solution in which data sharing can help farmers improve their production.</li>
  <li><b>FAIR PRICING:</b> Can dairy prices for farmers and other parties in the supply chain be generated or negotiated more fairly using software solutions?</li>
  <li><b>NOTHING WASTED:</b> Take on the challenge of decreasing food waste in one or all parts of the supply chain.</li>
  <li><b>DATA VISUALISATION:</b> Get creative with one or more datasets and design visual interfaces that give insights more easily.</li>
</ol>
